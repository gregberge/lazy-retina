## lazy-retina

Lazy-retina is based on fasterize lazyload, it's the same code with retina support and external options.

It's a standalone script that weights ~1KB minified gzipped.

## How to use ?

1. Add lazy-retina.min.js to your page before any `<script>` tag, either src or inline if
you do not have any other scripts in the `<head>`.
2. Change all `<img>` tags to lazyload :

```html
  <img
    data-src="real/image/src.jpg"
    src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
    onload="lzld(this)" onerror="lzld(this)"
    width="200" height="400" >
```

## And for non-lazyloaded images ?

It's possible to use lazy-retina for non-lazyloaded images, it's the same syntax and the same process :

1. Add lazy-retina.min.js to your page before any `<script>` tag, either src or inline if
you do not have any other scripts in the `<head>`.
2. Change all `<img>` tags to add support :

```html
  <img
    src="real/image/src.jpg"
    onload="lzld(this)" onerror="lzld(this)"
    width="200" height="400" >
```

## Who use it ?

lazy-retina is used on :

* [mobile.lemonde.fr](http://mobile.lemonde.fr/), news, 1st mobile website in France. [source](http://www.mediametrie.fr/internet/communiques/telecharger.php?f=26408ffa703a72e8ac0117e74ad46f33) (pdf)

## Configuration

We can configure lazy-retina for custom use :

```html
  <script src="lazy-retina.js"></script>
  <script>
    lzld.config.retina = true; // force retina
    lzld.config.lazy-attr = "data-mysrc-attr"; // change attribute
  </script>
```

* `retina` : Set the retina support, default `auto` (the retina is determined by `window.devicePixelRatio`), it accepts a boolean to force support.
* `hdCallback` : The callback to transform the `src` in a retina `src`, `var hdSrc = hdCallback(src)`;
* `lazyAttr` : The lazy attribute, default `data-src`.
* `minDevicePixelRatio` : The min device pixel ratio to enable retina in "auto" mode.
* `offset` : Vertical offset in px. Used for preloading images while scrolling

### The default hdCallback

The default hd callback simply add `@2x` to the img like on iOS platforms :

````javascript
function defaultHdCallback(src)
{
	var srcSegments = src.split("."),
	    srcWithoutExtension = srcSegments.slice(0, (srcSegments.length - 1)).join("."),
	    extension = srcSegments[srcSegments.length - 1];
	
	return srcWithoutExtension + "@2x." + extension;
}
````

## Methods

### lzld.update()

Force an update of all loaded images :

````javascript
// We force retina and we update all loaded images
lzld.config.retina = true;
lzld.update();
````

### lzld.isRetinaDevice()

Check if the device is retina according to `lzld.config.minDevicePixelRatio`.

## Browser support

*IE6+ or modern browser.*

IE6/7 originally does not support data uri:s images but using the onerror event on to-be-lazyloaded images, we're able to register the current image in the lazyloader.
The only drawback is that you can have red crosses showing that original data uri:s image cannot be loaded. But well, it's old IE so no big deal.

You can have IE6/7 support without the hack, use the `b.gif` image instead of the data uri:s and remove `onerror`.

## How does it works

Lazy-retina is based on fasterize lazyload, so it's efficient and speedy. You can see how the lazyload part works on https://github.com/fasterize/lazyload/.

The retina part is no more complicated, it test if retina is active and supported and execute a callback to modify the source in order to load the retina image file.
